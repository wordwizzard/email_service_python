# email_service_python

I decided to create this spesific script after various people told me to use legacy code to acomplish the mentioned.

That however "irked" me so I just wrote my own easy to understand emailing script in python.

I will be including the dependancy list as well. This was created in a virtual Enviroment.

# Dependancies:
Python 3.6
